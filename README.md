## Welcome, Toodle üê∂ü§ñ
10,000 Genesis Toodles spawned within the Ethereum blockchain in 2021, each equipped with a [Toodle Loot Bag NFT](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2A16107Ea0D28aE822168C8bB3eF5460b1924A78) and 15,000,000 [TODL](https://etherscan.io/token/0x98933f2396DBaABf812b6E6d27dA4DF109C4c55F) coins.

Users mint a Toodle Loot Bag to theme software projects using Cryptoodle's building blocks.

## Building Blocks
1. Each Toodle Loot Bag NFT is mapped to 1 Genesis Toodle. Its official contract address is: [0x2A16107Ea0D28aE822168C8bB3eF5460b1924A78](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2A16107Ea0D28aE822168C8bB3eF5460b1924A78)
2. Only 15,000,000 TODL tokens can be redeemed for each Toodle Loot Bag NFT. Its official contract address is: [0x98933f2396DBaABf812b6E6d27dA4DF109C4c55F](https://etherscan.io/token/0x98933f2396DBaABf812b6E6d27dA4DF109C4c55F)
3. There are an infinite number of "Toodles" but only a maximum of 10,000 "Genesis Toodles".
4. At the time of mint, the Toodle Loot Bag's Genesis Toodle spawns. One "Toodle" spawns every 24 hours from each Toodle Loot Bag after.
5. A Genesis Toodle/Toodle interacts with Toodle Loot Bags and TODL coins.
